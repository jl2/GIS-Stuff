hmrender

This utility uses 3Delight and GDAL to render a rotating view of NED dataset.

It was primarily created as a quick and dirty way to get a good view of a NED dataset.  It's not very robust and doesn't do much error checking.

To use it:
make
mkdir output
./hmrender outname /path/to/ned/adfFile.adf

This will open the file /path/to/ned/adfFile.adf, and create a series of images named "./output/outname0000.tif" .. "./output/outname0035.tif".
