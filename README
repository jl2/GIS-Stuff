This is a repo for some GIS related stuff I'm working on.

Some things I want to do:
    Create a script to mass download or selectively download GeoTIFF
        maps from libremap.org
    Create a database of the information in those maps, such as the
        boundary coordinates for each one
   Create a program that plots GPS tracks on the topo maps.  Ideally
       the program would stitch together multiple maps when necessary

My plan is to use the GDAL library from Python.
